# Weather Dashboard

For this assignment I had to create a weather dashboard that would leverage APIs to pull in information about a city's current weather and 5 day forecast. I had to use multiple APIs to ensure when the user inputs a city name, the APIs can call that city from both it's name and it's latitude and longitude coordinates. My webpage also had to be able to save the searched cities into local storage so that the user can easily press on the button that displays a cities name that was previously searched.
